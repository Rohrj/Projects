	<p>As per usual with most cryptids, westerners become aware of their possible existance much later than the natives of the region. The name Mokele-Mbembe, when translated from Lingala (the language of the indigenous peoples of the Congo basin), literally means "one that stops the flow of rivers". This massive creature has been living among the natives of the Congo for thousands of years. The most common physical description of this dinosaur is that it is as large as an elephant and resembles a sauropod (long neck, large body, dinosaur-like). The pygmies living in the area have stories that say the Mokele-Mbembe is an herbivore and eats mainly vines. </p>

	<p>In 1932, Ivan T. Sanderson, a prominent cryptozoologist, took an expedition to the Congo. With the natives as guides, he found large tracks and witnessed a creature (larger than a hippo) slip under the river water He also heard a story from the pygmies about their own encounters with the beast. They had dammed up the river entrance to Lake Tele with a wall of spears. Two angry Mokele-Mbembe attacked the dam and the pygmies defended themselves and killed one of the creatures with a spear. In 1983, a noted zoologist who was on an expedition witnessed a large head and long neck emerge from the lake water and confirmed it was not a snake, crocodile, nor a turtle. Many expeditions took place in the Congo between 1909 and 2017, but still no solid proof has been discovered. The Mokele-Mbembe will most likely continue to evade humans for a long time since the Congo is so dense with jungle and, considering it is suggested to be a prehistoric species, there is probably very few specimans still living.</p>
