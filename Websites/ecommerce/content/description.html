  Enchanté Vintage & Studio needs a multi-page e-commerce website to sell furs and accessories.
  These products are high quality and vintage minks that have been well-kept in cold storage.
  The accessories offered are unique handbags, vintage earrings, and hand-crafted topiaries.
  Users can read blog posts, read about the owner of Enchanté Vintage & Studio, contact the owner directly if they have any questions or concerns, and visit our social media sites to share us with their friends and family.
  All ordering will be done through Etsy.
  The new domain name will point to a hosted server running, Anti-spam tools for staff emails, and weekly automatic backup.  
  Content will be managed using Wordpress with Wordfence, Jetpack, and Akismet defensives plugged in. 
  Two administrators will have login credentials for the hosting, domain, and website accounts.  
  Success and maintenance of the website will be monitored using JetPack, WordFence, Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager.
