      <h2>Design</h2>
      <h3>Page layout and spacing</h3>
      <p>
        Your site looks beautiful! It is simple, but very effective at clearly arranging and presenting the content of the site.Your
        In terms of page layout and spacing, one recommendation would be to widen the body of the page for desktop views. 
        It looks great in tablet and mobile view, but there is too much white space on either side of the body when i'm viewing it on my desktop.
        You could also center the header to fill up that space, although, the way it is now is not a problem either.
      </p>
      <h3>Functionality of navigation, forms, and widgets</h3>
      <p>
        All navigation, forms, and widgets function properly and some of your more detailed widgets/plugins are fantastic.
        My only suggestion is to add some more functionality with the search function if possible. Searching for words or phrases works great, but perhaps you can
        add a way to search for categories and tags as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Color scheme</h3>
      <p>
        The purple and green in the header are great colors and I would like to see them show up more in your pages or navigation bar.
        You could change the nav hover to one of the colors instead of the light gray. 
      </p>
      <h3>Logo (symbol and wordmark) design</h3>
      <p>
        Your logo has a great design! I would suggest making it slightly larger and making the lines thicker to give it some more emphasis.
      </p>
      <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
      <p>
        I tested your website in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Internet Explorer, and I can find no frontend compatibility issues.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Descriptive title tag</h3>
      <p>
        Your title tag is descriptive enough, but if I had to suggest one thing, I would recommend that you make your tagline less specific. If you wanted to add musical arrangments for different genres, than your tagline would be
        one more thing you would have to edit.
      </p>
      <h3>Descriptive navigation items</h3>
      <p>
        The one suggestion I would make here is to change About Us and Contact Us to About Me and Contact Me since you are the only one arranging the music. It lets the user know they can contact you personally.
      </p>
      <h3>Descriptive headlines and subheadlines</h3>
      <p>
        Your headlines perfectly describe exactly what content the posts will contain. My only suggestion is to be careful with using too many exclamation points. Even though I don't have a problem with enthusiasm, some users may
        be find it off-putting.
      </p>
      <h3>Grammatically correct writing</h3>
      <p>
        The only grammatical error I could find is located in the last sentence of the Advertising section of the Legal page where "sensitive" is spelled wrong. Other than that, the grammar and spelling looks good.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of keyword phrases that promote the site</h3>
      <p>
        I would recommend adding an additional post or two that detail what other arrangements will be available on your site in the future. This will allow Google to associate more search phrases and keywords with your site instead of just
        Avengers related phrases.
      </p>
      <h3>Policy page completeness</h3>
      <p>
        Your policy page is well-written and complete. My only concern is the use of your real address (or at least a real address) near the bottom of the page. This could be a dangerous security risk as you never know what kind of things people on the internet
        would do with that type of information.
      </p>
      <h3>Helpful language for all interactive functions (forms)</h3>
      <p>
        Honestly, your forms are extremely informative. The language within the input boxes would help even the newest of internet users to send a message.
      </p>
      <h3>Value of content related to the ecommerce page.</h3>
      <p>
        I feel descriptions under the pieces would really draw users in since they will want to read about where the music comes from and who originally composed it. Maybe have a video or audio track, too, that allows the user to listen
        to whatever piece they are looking to purchase.
