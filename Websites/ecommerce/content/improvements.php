      <h3>Four improvements and their results.</h3>
      <p>
        1. I optimized the images on my site with a new image optimizer plugin called Imagify. This saves me around 2 mb of space overall. 2. I used the Autoptimizer plugin to optimize my html, javascript, and css files. This eliminated some various blocking
        resources that were slowing down my load times.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. I optimized the images on my site with a new image optimizer plugin called Imagify. The images now load quicker since they are smaller in size. 4. I used the Autoptimizer plugin to optimize my html, javascript, and css files. This allows my website
        to load faster on mobile devices because it isn't spending uneccessary time loading resources.
